# 2nd Year

My second year involved two major projects.

## Fikalab Management System

Fikalab is an innovation laboratory created by the company "Critical Software", whose objective is to provide opportunities for its employees and partners to freely innovate, develop ideas and learn new concepts in which they may be interested. The laboratory is responsible for managing various initiatives in which it can reward projects and also for controlling a series of resources and materials that are made available to employees to develop their plans. The main objective of the project was to develop a Web application to facilitate the management of these two major responsibilities, which until then were done completely manually. 

The resulting application was developed by a team of 8 people, using "React", "Spring Boot" and "MySQL", "Elastic Search", with its functionalities based on a survey of requirements obtained from recurrent interviews with active users of the laboratory and their respective managers. 

My primary contributions were in Backend Development. I designed and developed the inventory/resource management components, as well as the majority of the backends' integrations with Elastic Search. Unfortunately, I am unable to share the source code of the project.

## Mining hints for fixing formal specifications

Master thesis that involved the investigation and development of techniques for correcting formal specifications based on data. The objective of this work was to design an automatic suggestion and repair system for a formal modeling language called Alloy. This system would have to be capable of generating instant feedback to users in order to be viable enough to be implemented on an online learning platform called Alloy4Fun. 

The developed system, SpecAssistant, is a hint generation system based on data mining. It takes advantage of Alloy4Fun's public dataset to create a series of custom problem-solving templates for Alloy challenges used to instantly create suggestions for users. The project consisted of four activities. It began with a literature review on hint generation systems and automatic program repair. It continued with an exploratory activity of Alloy4Fun's historical data. It ended with the implementation of the SpecAssistant system and its quantitative evaluation. During implementation, the following technologies were used: "Alloy", "Quarkus", "Java", "JavaScript", "Meteor" and "MongoDB".

The source code for this project can be found in the repository [K1yps/SpecAssistant](https://github.com/K1yps/SpecAssistant). A direct implementation of the system is also found in the Alloy4fun fork: [K1yps/Alloy4Fun](https://github.com/K1yps/Alloy4Fun/tree/dev).
